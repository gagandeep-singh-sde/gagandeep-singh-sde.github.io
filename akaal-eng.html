      <h1 class="h2-over">I bow down to the Timeless</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Have you ever wondered, what does being "Timeless" mean? or how can something or someone be "Timeless". I mean, how can you imagine such a state. Sometimes, I ask myself what time is; what is its true nature. Is it linear like a flowing river which can only flow in one direction as our past actions can influence our present and future but not the other way around? Or is it "Dilated" where it acts like a wave which varies according to its surroundings? Some have proposed time a non-linear entity in which case our future can influence our past and present. Of course, this one is just a theory but Time Dilation isn't. For me, they are very intriguing questions that I ask myself often. </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">To understand what does being "Timeless" means one must understand the true nature of time itself.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Would you like to?</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">I don't expect everyone to continue reading further but those who seek the absolute truth, wonder about the nature of reality and amazed by this universe, I may have a gem for you. So please stick with me throughout the article. There may be some heavy stuff to digest.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">So let us understand first, the nature of time. Shall we?</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Do you know that time can be slowed down or fastened? Yes, it is possible. Interesting, isn't it? Time acts as a wave, like what light is and a wave has a maximum speed limit with which it can travel and can never exceed it. That speed is approximately 3 lakh km per second. Light travels with this speed and must remain at this speed. Hence the speed of light is constant throughout the universe and is the maximum speed at which any object can travel. All matter exhibits wave nature as well apart from the conventional particle nature. </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Consider a train travelling at the speed of light and you are sitting inside of it. Now suppose you get up and start running inside the train in the same direction the train is running. What do you think will happen? </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Time will slow down for you. Hours will be passed outside the train but for you, it will just be seconds. Let's assume you ran for half an hour inside the train running at the speed of light as soon as the train stops and you get out of it, you will find that several years have been passed and you are in future.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">How did this happen? you ask.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">You'll just need some basic physics to understand that. I told you that speed of light must remain constant and you may know that the formula for speed is distance divided by time. The moment you start running inside the train you try to break the barrier of the speed of light by adding your speed with that of the train which is already running at the speed of light. Since speed must remain constant for a particular distance, time must slow down to compensate the additional speed. Gravity exists to prevent time dilation but that is not the topic, for now. This is the reason why 5 minutes spent on some far planet with very high gravity can result in 10 years spent on earth. This phenomenon is known as Time Dilation.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">I told you all this just to say that "Time doesn't exist". Yes, you read it right. Time is just a name given to change of one entity with respect to another entity. It is relative like everything else which exists in this universe. </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Your age is just a result of your biological change with respect to the movement of the Earth around the Sun which we know as days.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">The morning and night are just changes which occur while earth completes its rotation around its axis.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">When you were in the train, running, trying to break the barrier of speed your biological processes were slowed down, your thoughts were slowed down with respect to the rest of the world and as a result, you happened to be in future.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Time is just in the mind of the perceiver, it is just a coined term which is there to make everything seem, simpler.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">"Timeless" is the one who doesn't change with respect to anything and is absolute. But, how it can be that something never changes its state and is absolute in an ever-expanding universe which is changing its state continuously, where the cycle of birth and death is ever pervading. Is it inside the Universe, outside of it? or does "The Timeless" made the Universe? Maybe "The Timeless" is the universe. </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">To answer these questions I must ask you another one.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Do you dream? I ask.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">When you do, you have the ability to create your own universe just like the one you live in. You can create your own reality where the laws of the universe don't limit you, in fact, you can create your own laws. You can make yourself fly, make a dog speak, resurrect the dead back to life or make someone dust in the blink of an eye. You are able to do this because of your consciousness. The whole universe you made resides in your consciousness and you are present in that universe yourself, in the form of the universe but at the same time, you are outside of it, dreaming it and that universe is true and exists until you wake up.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Do you know what will happen if one of the characters in your dream starts talking to you, you the dreamer? What will happen if some character finds out that he/she is not real but is actually in an illusion? He/She starts looking into his/her consciousness and finds out his/her origin of existence, which is you. The moment that character finds you, able to talk to you, able to remove his/her illusion that he /she exists; that character will wake up but not as him/her but as you. You!, will wake up</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">When will we, actually wake up and look inside our consciousness?</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">What if you look inside your own consciousness and tries to find your true self. Maybe you will find the one who created this universe in which you are living right now.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Yes, we are as well, like that character in your dream living in an illusion called "Maya".</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">The whole universe came into existence the moment GOD thought about it. "The Big Bang" happened, through the supreme consciousness, the whole universe got created, all the laws of the universe which we study in science got created which are known as "Hukum". The whole universe and the living beings are sustained by "Hukum", follows "Hukum". The "Hukums" that we understand becomes a science for us and the ones we don't understand we consider them myths.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Before the birth of the universe, there was no space as well. Can you imagine anything which doesn't need three-dimensional space to exist? </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Your thoughts. The consciousness, it doesn't need space or any of the other four elemnts fire, water, earth or air to exist.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">The only thing which connects us and GOD with each other is our consciousness in the same way you were connected with the character of your dream. We are all connected with each other through the supreme consciousness. We live inside the supreme consciousness of GOD and now you know how GOD is omnipresent, has no eyes but has infinite eyes.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">The moment you find your true self inside of you, you become one with your true self which is GOD. The whole universe will just be a thought or dream of yours and then that true self can shuffle the directions of a building in Meca in the blink of an eye, you can alter the nature of rock to wax or you can fight a battle placing your head on your palm and so on. There will remain no limit.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">GOD is the only Timeless being the absolute truth, the truth which was there before the creation of the universe, which was there at the creation of the universe, which is omnipresent now and which will be there forever. GOD never dies because GOD was never born in the first place, something cannot end which never started, which never changes its state hence is "Timeless". GOD started time. GOD is the only real entity that exists and the purpose of our life is to wake up, to find our true selves by meeting the Guru.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">I tried contemplating "Akaal" in context to as little Gurbani as I understand with as small intellect as I am blessed with, I by no means saying that this is the complete meaning of "Akaal" but I now know that this is the bare minimum of it.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">"No one can understand Gurbani completely until one becomes 'No one' ".</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">We can only become one with Waheguru by losing our idea that we exist, our "Haumai" and that can only be done by True Love.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Thanks a lot for reading this article to the end. Please do comment and share your thoughts.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh (The Khalsa belogs to Waheguru, The victory belongs to Waheguru)</p>
