      <p class="paragraph-text">A few days back when I was on my way, I saw a disabled child on a wheelchair bicycle coming towards me. I was on my bike, he said something to me but I didn't understand what he was saying as I was going fast. I turned and came back to him. I thought he needed help.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">I saw that child. He was disabled from his legs, his legs were as thin as a stick. He must have been around 10-12 yrs old. He was wearing really old clothes but he had a kind of personality, like a character that I can not describe. He didn't seem to feel the disability at all. I asked him what he was saying.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">He said, "Mainu ded so rupya de mai chiddi shika laina" (Give me one hundred fifty rupees I want to buy a badminton set). I smiled as I was thinking, he didn't beg me to give him money instead he ordered like I wasn't a stranger rather someone he knew. I felt he is trying to be sneaky and doesn't want to hurt his self-respect. I admired this quality of his though.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">He then said "Hege a pese tere kol" (Do you have the money) with some attitude keeping his self-respect intact. I said No, I don't have any money.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">I was expecting him to say how much do you have then ten, twenty or anything. But he didn't ask for anything and said: "chl chnga ja fer" (okay then go away).</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">I was surprised and I sensed "Fakiri" in that child. He wasn't trying to defend his self-respect all along rather he had an attitude of a "Fakir". He was as carefree as a king could be. He wanted something but didn't care enough if he is going to get it or not. He did his job of asking for it but didn't have any expectations. This moved me.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">I gave him Fifty rupees (I didn't had cash with me at that time) and asked him you don't do any "Nasha" right? He said I don't "apna km ni o". He bought some snacks with the money as I saw him from a distance. He didn't even bother saving the money for what he initially wanted.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Call me crazy, but he gave me a glimpse of fakiri. I even think that that kid is more spiritually ahead than me. Someone like me wearing "Bana" (spiritual attire) means nothing if I don't have the qualities that it takes to be worthy of wearing it and one of them is fakiri. For some time, the feeling of fakiri stayed with me. I was feeling so carefree, my wants and haves didn't matter. I was  so content that I felt as light as a feather, filled with love for Guru Nanak as just before leaving home I read some beautiful lines written about the fakiri of Guru Nanak by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/pannujasvindarsingh/">@pannujasvindarsingh</a>. The incident reminded me of the subtleties of being a Sikh of Guru Nanak, being a fakir while being a householder, being a "Raja Jogi". This can only be taught in the house of Guru Nanak.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">We often don't realise the weight of our wishes, desires and thoughts that we carry on our shoulders. They only get bigger and bigger as we move through life. We forget about the purpose of our life. We become slaves of our desires and get anxious. On the other hand, the power of fakiri can make a king, beggar in front of a fakir as Sikander once became.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Being a fakir doesn't mean we have to give up our house, our car, our business or job rather it's an attitude where we are not slaves of our desires and belongings, the illusion of we have something. Someone could be a King of 7 continents and still be a fakir, we have the examples, haven't we?</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Of course, it takes a lot of courage for someone to give up expectations on their desires and wishes which they had for the longest time now. Even considering the possibility of not being able to get something that you want so badly is really unsettling. But what if, we give up all our desires, wishes and illusion of ownership. What if, we ask God for the courage to do so. We will become the kings and queens that we are supposed to be. After all it is a divine quality that can only be earned with the blessings of God.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Could we ever be able to give up all our desires and wishes? After having just a tiny glimpse of it I think it is worth anything.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Thanks a lot for reading this article to the end. Please do comment and share your thoughts.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-text">P.S: That kid called me uncle and I said to myself "Dude! you are getting old ðŸ˜‚". As a matter of fact, today is my birthday as well.</p>
