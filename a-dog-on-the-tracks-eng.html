      <h1>A dog on the tracks</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-text">I am not very much interested in writing. But there are some events in life that pass by saying something. I can't restrain myself but to think deeply about those events and it seems mandatory for me to write those thoughts on a paper. </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Before telling this story, I would like to mention that some of you may find this story ordinarily simple and I agree with you. The story may seem ordinary but the philosophy in this story is about that hidden letter which has been lost in between other words. </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">This is 23 February 2017, I was waiting for my train at a railway station. The time would be about 4:45 PM. As usual, the train was late. Wandering around, I saw a dog sitting just on the tracks eating the flesh of a dead animal. It seemed like the dog was hungry for many days now. He also seemed very weak, as I could even see his bones through his skin. I felt pity for him. Though an animal had died and another animal was eating the flesh of it, I was happy seeing the dog's stomach is being filled up "One died but one who survived utilized".</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Some time passed and I heard an emerging sound of a coming train, It was time for the train to come. When I saw the train coming from far away, I realized it wasn't the train in which I was going to go instead this train was not even going to stop on the platform. </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">The dog was on the same track through which the train was going to pass. Believe me, I was completely confident that the dog will run away as he will realise the train approaching, but he didn't run even when the train came closer. I tried running him away by shouting at him, but he was so lost in the taste of flesh which he found after so many days that he didn't realize that the train was coming at him. I picked up a small stone lying below a tree near me and hit him with it. The stone didn't hit and passed by closely. When the train came very close I panicked and hit him with a heavy stone.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">The dog ran away whining.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">The train went by and the dog survived. After the train passes, I saw him whining in pain. Know the truth, I felt very miserable seeing the condition of that dog. I tried uplifting myself thinking " What else could I have done, I couldn't have gone on the tracks myself? ". </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">That dog didn't come back to eat that piece of flesh.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">But before he went away, he looked at me for an instant and by seeing him a thought came into my mind " I don't know what he will think of me, perhaps he will think of me like those illiterate people who hit him to hurt him intentionally". He didn't realize what had happened to him, I was just a criminal who hurt him and took away his food. </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">He was reasonable though, I did hurt him, I surely took away his food. But I was also feeling miserable listening to his whining.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">No doubt, the stone which was thrown by me hurt him badly. But, that same stone saved his life.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">This was a simple incident which may happen to dozens of people daily. But, my eyes went wet when I remembered: " I was also hit many times by GOD ". It was this particular moment when I started revisiting my whole previous life with a different perspective. </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Put yourself in the place of that dog and think about those stones with which GOD has hit you. How many times would GOD have saved us? The sad thing is that we were not able to see the hidden truth behind those troubles. But, this is also true and thus seems reasonable that our little nugget's brain cannot absorb that ocean of GOD.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">On that day, I started believing in a proverb wholeheartedly " Whatever happens, happens on his own (GOD's) will, Whatever happens, happens for good".</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">This was the thought that came into my mind at that time and I dropped it on my diary as it is. I do not expect everyone to read this thought and like it, but perhaps there will be some whose eyes become moist, some will appreciate this thought and some will read it and forget it.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">The difference? the difference will be of the sorrows that they have seen in their life.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">"GOD doesn't decide our destiny, instead gives us choices. Our choices in return decide our destiny." _Gagandeep Singh</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">I may not be able to put all my emotions through this article but that may be because of some language constraints, if you find so, do read the article in Punjabi.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Please do comment and share your thought with me. </p>

              <div>Well! this is a gentleman's writing! It happens literally we argue, fight or even ignore people for the sake of there future reliability which they are pretty much unaware of, as some have vision to rectify the situation! Person like you have such distant vision. Very much appreciable thoughts.</div>
